This is an autoclicker that I created to complete repetative tasks in games that I play.

To create a sequence of clicks, aim the cursor where you want it to click and press F5 for left or F6 for right clicks.  This will add it to the list of clicks which can be copied to the end of the list or deleted by selecting the action and pressing 'c' or 'd'.

The click delay is the minimum amount of time the program will wait between clicks.  A click delay variance can be added so that the program will wait the full click delay + a random amount of time between 0 and the variance number selected.

The pixel offput is how many pixels (-x to x) to randomize the click area by.  This means that if the click is set to happen at (100,100) and the offput is 5, the valid area will be 95-105 on each coordinate.

After creating a sequence of clicks, you can enter some notes for the sequence and save it as a script from the menu.  This will create a .mcs file which can be loaded at a later time to access previously created click sequences.  (Click delay and variance is not currently saved).
